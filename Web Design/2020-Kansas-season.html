          <h2>History of Kansas Basketball</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/james-naismith/12154">James Naismith</a> was the <b>inventor of basketball</b>, and was Kansas' first head basketball coach.</p>
        <p><strong>Forrest Clare "Phog" Allen</strong> is known as the <em>"Father of Basketball Coaching."</em> He coached at Kansas from 1907–1909 then again from 1919–1956</p>
        <p>Under his tutelage, many of the most noteable coaches played under him. Of note: Dean Smith and Adolph Rupp played for James Naismith.</p>
        <p>Kansas' current arena Allen Fieldhouse is named for "Phog" Allen.</p>
    <aside><h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Gerry Fey</strong>, and I graduated from the University of Kansas. I love Kansas Basketball. While I was at Kansas, I went to every Kansas home basketball game. I covered the team for the school paper, The Kansan, and loved every moment of it.</p>
        <p>I have put together the reasons why Kansas deserves a 2020 National Championship banner.</p>
