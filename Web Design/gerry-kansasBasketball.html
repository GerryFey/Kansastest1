        <p><strong>Forrest Clare "Phog" Allen</strong> is known as the <em>"Father of Basketball Coaching."</em> He coached at Kansas from 1907–1909 then again from 1919–1956</p>
        <p>Under his tutelage, many of the most noteable coaches played under him. Of note: Dean Smith and Adolph Rupp played for James Naismith.</p>
