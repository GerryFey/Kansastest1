        <h2>History of Kansas Basketball</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/james-naismith/12154" target="_blank">James Naismith</a> was the <b>inventor of basketball</b>, and was Kansas' first head basketball coach.</p>
        <p><strong>Forrest Clare "Phog" Allen</strong> is known as the <em>"Father of Basketball Coaching."</em> He coached at Kansas from 1907–1909 then again from 1919–1956</p>
        <p>Under his tutelage, many of the most noteable coaches played under him. Of note: Dean Smith and Adolph Rupp played for James Naismith.</p>
        <p>Kansas' current arena Allen Fieldhouse is named for "Phog" Allen.</p>
        <details><summary><b>Great quote about why Kansas is special</b></summary>
            <blockquote>"There's no better place to coach, there's no better place to go to school, there's no better place to play (than Kansas)." &mdash; <cite><i>Larry Brown</i></cite></blockquote></details>

    <h3>Lyrics to the Alma Mater</h3>
    "Far above the golden valley<br>
        Glorious to view,<br>
        Stands our noble Alma Mater,<br>
        Towering toward the blue.<br>
   &nbsp;<br>
        <b>CHORUS:</b><br>
        Lift the chorus ever onward,<br>
        Crimson and the blue<br>
        Hail to thee, our Alma Mater<br>
        Hail to old KU."<br>
